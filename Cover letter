PROJECT - OCR 12

This project aims to use machine learning to advance OCR  for handwritten text.
If executed properly it has the potential to help millions of mom-pop store owners in india to help keep track of inventory.
Capture image of the bill and get the details of the good to the system. Collect written orders and huge help in filing G.S.T tax.
It can also be used for digitizing handwritten class notes to various formats.
The app will allow users to capture an image of a hand written text  using phone camera and process it into recognizable text and convert that text into a txt or PDF format.

TIME FRAME

The project is at an early stage. I have listed down to all the skills required to complete this project successfully. The project research stage is completed.I have clearly planned all the front-end aspect of the app . I am at the wireframing stage of the app . I have made some sketches on the various screens of the app. I have completed gathering sample data to execute this project. I have planned the layout of the app.
I could use Google's technical help in the later stages of coding the app as well as with the final testing and deployment of the app.
I can deliver the prototype app on 15th of march and the final app around the 1st of May. If I get a little help and a little luck.
